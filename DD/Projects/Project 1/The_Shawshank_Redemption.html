	<h1>The Shawshank Redemption</h1>
	<div>
	<h4>Release date: September 23, 1994</h4>
	<h4>Director:  Frank Darabont</h4>
	<h4>Genre: Crime Fiction, Mystery</h4>
	<p>Andy Dufresne is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover, and got jailed at Shawshank prison. His life seems to have taken a turn for the worse, but fortunately Andy befriends some of the other inmates, in particular a character known only as Red. Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can in a prison, leaving a message for all that while the body may be locked away in a cell, the spirit can never be truly imprisoned.</p>
		<p>Most interesting part was how he was able to survive and got out from the prison.</p>
