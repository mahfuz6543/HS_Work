		<h2>Ms. Austin's Teaching Experience</h2>
		
		<p>I still remember one lesson where she told us about her hopes for her future when she was our age. I think she meant to be talking about science, but it changed, and kind of became a life study. She told us about her regrets, and her successes, and for some reason, it all resonated with me, and I started to realize that anything really is possible.
