    <h1>Favorite Teacher</h1>
    <h2>Ms. Austin</h2>
    <p>I just want to share with you all how much I enjoyed being in her Global History class last year. In our Web Design class we are actually being assigned to take an interview to our most favorite teacher. And she is  the one who came into my mind first.
      She is truly an amazing teacher for all of us. History was one of my weakest subject, and sje pushed me hard to do complete the assignments, the notes sje gave us at the end of the year and the index cards, those helped me a lot for getting a better score on the regent. I enjoyed the time when she used to share the stories in the middle of the study.
     </p>
    <p>Ms Austin is the teacher that changed my school life. She is very polite, funny. She always being nice to us. She treat us like we are her children. She was my Global History teacher. As a learning fact, she used to give us long time to finish up homework, she used to teach us with every explanation. Before the regents we got to review with playing games. She loved to share her life story during the middle of the study so that student doesnâ€™t get bore and get more inspire by them. Students were very close to her by that students participated freely without any fear. And I loved when she brought doughnuts for everyone before the test. </p>
