		<h2>Animal Rights</h2>
		
		<p>Animal rights are the ideas in which some, or all, non-human animals are entitled to the possession of their own existence and that their most basic interests—such as the need to avoid suffering— should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings. Our group knows and feels the pain that these animals are going through, we are here to speak for those who to have no voice and to stand up for what is right in treating animals in a more human way.</p>
